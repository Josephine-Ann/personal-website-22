## Getting Started

npm run dev

## A Little Bit About This Project
I created this project to experiment while focusing on front end. I am currently transitioning and, as someone with a background in Fine Art, I wanted to show off some of my transferible skills. I am going to work on a project that is solely based on back end (next-backend-integration: https://github.com/Josephine-Ann/next-backend-integration), and I will eventually integrate the two.

## Things I learnt from this project:
I got to better understand hooks. 
I learnt about transitions. 
I worked with responsive content.
